# Dice Roller

The game is pretty easy! Two players aim to reach the highest score. How? Rolling dices.

When the game start each player has `0` total points and `0` current points.

The first player - `Player 1` - starts the game by rolling the dice by pressing the `ROLL DICE` button. If the value of the rolled dice is more than one the current points increase depending on the value of the dice, otherwise all its current points are erased and the current player becomes the other player - `Player 2`.

So how can you increase the total score? By deciding whether to hold your current points or not. If you press the `HOLD` button, all the obtained current points are summed to the total points and the other player becomes the current player.
